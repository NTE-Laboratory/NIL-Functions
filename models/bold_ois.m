function [b,o]=bold_ois()
%

% bold signals stems from the amount of dHb in a voxel and as a result
% to the magnetic properties of dHb, oHb is relatively diamagnetic and
% thought to be magneitcally invisible (this should be verified)

% ois at 620nm is mostly sensitive (~85%) to the amount of dHb and minimally 
% to the amount of oHb (~15%) and as a result also to the changes in 
% hematocrit in a voxel
